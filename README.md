# Mechanical Midi Music
### [Open GUI](https://djthefirst.github.io/Mechanical-Midi-Music/)


**M³** is a framework designed to allow easy development of new microcontroller-based MIDI instruments. 

Initially inspired by **Flanon _ FT Tech Labs** [Musical Orchestra ](https://youtu.be/2UesaCcfI_8?t=24) and roughly based on the [Moppy Drive Project](https://github.com/Sammy1Am/Moppy2) by **[Sammy1Am](https://github.com/Sammy1Am)** the **M³** project hopes to help tinkerers discover the magic of true electronic music.
