# Mechanical Midi Music

**M³** is a framework designed to allow easy development of new microcontroller-based MIDI instruments. Initially inspired by Flanon _ FT Tech Labs [Musical Orchestra ](https://youtu.be/2UesaCcfI_8?t=24) and roughly based on the [Moppy Drive Project](https://github.com/Sammy1Am/Moppy2) by [Sammy1Am](https://github.com/Sammy1Am) the **M³** project hopes to help tinkerers discover the magic of true electronic music.
